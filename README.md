Data science project @ TU_KL on covid-19 dataset

The goal of this project is to create dynamic dashboard for final submission of Enterprise Data science lecture at TU KL by deploying the best practices of data science from the industry while developing a COVID-19 analysis prototype.

The final output contains a dynamic dashboard - which can be updated by one click and displays COVID-19 & 20 data with filtered and calculated data sets like the current Doubling Rate of confirmed cases.

Techniques and python packages used are GITHUB repository, REST Services, and Python Pandas, matplotlib, Scipy, scikit-learn, Facebook Prophet, Plotly, Dash, + bonus section Tableau respectively.

Here, I followed an industry-standard process (known as CRISP-DM) by focusing on the iterative nature of agile development.

* Business understanding (the goal)
* Data Understanding (acquiring and cleaning of data)
* Data Preparation (data transformation and visualization for specific use)
* Modeling (Statistics, Machine Learning, and SIR Simulations on acquired data)
* Deployment (delivering the results in form of dynamic dashboards in python and Tableau)

The entire project follows the development flow of a rapid prototype project.
